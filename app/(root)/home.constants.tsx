                  In Vitro Fertilization is usually performed by an experienced IVF specialist and gynecologist. A doctor holding a specialized degree
                  in obstetrics and gynecology with relevant experience and training in ART (Assisted Reproductive Technology) is qualified to conduct
                  Invitro Fertilization. These professionals play an important role in guiding couples through the complexities of IVF, ensuring an

                <p className='text-gray-700 mb-8'>
                  IVF is considered a major procedure as it involves several difficult steps such as retrieving eggs and sperm, after which they are
                  induced for fertilization outside the body.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  The intricacies of the procedure describe it as a significant medical intervention, requiring careful and special attention at its
                  various stages. Since IVF addresses infertility and involves critical steps such as embryo development and transfer, it is
                  classified as a major procedure in the field of reproductive medicine.

                  If you are looking for IVF costs in fertility clinics in Gurgaon, it can range from around ₹1.00 lakh to ₹2.00 lakh for one cycle.
                  Some parts of the IVF process are essential, and some are optional, which most clinics treat as add-ons to the base fee. Depending
                  on your needs, an IVF cycle can cost ₹1.00 lakh or more. Often, the total bill falls between ₹1.00 lakh to ₹2.00 lakh.

                  Often, the clinic's basic fee for IVF will include the appointment, blood tests, egg retrieval, and follow-up care. Always ask for a
                  clear list of what is included in the basic fee and what will be charged as additional charges.

                  If you're making a budget for IVF Treatment, consider that you may have to undergo multiple embryo transfers or multiple full cycles
                  of IVF. If the first transfer does not result in a successful pregnancy and birth, ask your clinic about the cost of additional
                  embryo transfers. Some couples need to try IVF several times before getting pregnant. Some clinics offer a lower price for a second
                  or third try. It's hard to predict how well IVF will work for you, but your clinic can give you an idea based on factors like your
                  age, the health of your eggs, and the quality of your partner or donor's sperm.
